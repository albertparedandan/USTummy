This is my COMP 4521 - Mobile App Development Project.

This is a React Native app to browse, store and rate recipes of dishes that are available on HKUST supermarkets. I will also be attempting to learn how to do version control by using master, develop and feature branches.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you to clone and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
```
npm start
```

### Prerequisites
* Node@12
* expo-cli
* xcode-command line tools for Mac/equivalent for your platform
